# p5.touchgui

Note: This is a **work in progress** that is in **very early** stages of development.

*p5.js* is a wonderfully accessible way for students and creative minds to both learn computer programming and create interactive art and experiences. While helping teach network media and interactivity as a TA in UCLA’s Design Media Arts department, I couldn’t help but notice a recurring pattern. Students would dive into the *p5.js* editor, create exciting interactive sketches and animations, and then hit a wall when they wanted to start adding UI elements to their work. Many were absolute beginners to coding of any kind, and to jump from connecting basic shapes and variables to adding HTML elements or designing their own JavaScript buttons became a major hurdle. As accessible as *p5.js* is, there is currently no user-friendly way to add UI elements entirely within the sketch itself.

*p5.touchgui* is intended to fill that void, providing an easy-to-use GUI library that enables beginners and advanced users alike to quickly iterate on ideas with buttons, sliders, toggles, and joysticks that work with both mouse and multi-touch input.
